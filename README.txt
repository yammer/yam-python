Yampy2
======

Yampy 2 is a Python library extending the original official Yampy package with a number of improvements and updates.

I created this project because the official package has not been updated in 3 years and pull-requests are not being merged. 

Yampy ("Yam Pie") is the official Python library for interacting with Yammer's
API.


## Installation

Install with pip::

    pip install yampy2

Or manually::

    git clone git://github.com/tonybaloney/yam-python.git
    cd yam-python
    python setup.py install
